# CABattle

An intense, two player Cellular Automata Battle to the death!

Grow your CA and then place it in the arena!

WIP, controls + gameplay not final.

Instructions:

Run index.html

Each player must press their select button twice to initially place a CA. Move around the arena and keep on placing your CAs!

This current version is definitely not final and is still being worked on! I'm planning to drastically change how you grow and modify the Cellular Automata.


Controls:

Player 1:

Move: WASD, Select: Shift

Player 2:

Move: Arrow keys, Select: Control
